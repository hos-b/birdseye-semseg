[ ] find singular transform
[X] use (weighted?) cross entropy
[ ] try with no difficulty elevation
[ ] better metric for eleveation
[ ] increase batch size
[ ] better latent masking
[ ] adapt distributed training script

what possibly made it worse:
[X] changing tight sigmoid to sigmoid
[X] changing detached to attached
[X] weight losses

trying this round:
training 1: detached sigmoid + focal
training 2: detached sigmoid + ce
