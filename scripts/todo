[ ] find singular transform
[X] use (weighted?) cross entropy
[X] try with no difficulty elevation
[ ] better metric for eleveation
[ ] increase batch size
[ ] better latent masking
[ ] adapt distributed training script
[ ] full step by step pipeline check
[ ] try small net but detach for mask
[X] try just fitting semseg
[ ] try just fitting semseg without feature warping

what possibly made it worse:
[X] changing tight sigmoid to sigmoid
[ ] changing detached to attached -> probably not
[X] weight losses -> ruins both sort of
[X] MCNN4 + attached sigmoid masking -> performance degradation leaks to mask branch

trying this round:
training 1: small net just for semseg w/o aggregation
training 2: small net just for semseg
