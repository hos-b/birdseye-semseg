[ ] find singular transform
[X] use (weighted?) cross entropy
[ ] try with no difficulty elevation
[ ] better metric for eleveation
[ ] increase batch size
[ ] better latent masking
[ ] adapt distributed training script
[ ] full step by step pipeline check
[ ] try small net but detach for mask

what possibly made it worse:
[X] changing tight sigmoid to sigmoid
[ ] changing detached to attached -> probably not
[X] weight losses -> very likely

trying this round:
training 1: attached sigmoid + focal - weighted losses
training 2: attached sigmoid + ce	 - weighted losses

to do if it wasn't detach():
another round with tight sigmoid
another round without weighted losses
